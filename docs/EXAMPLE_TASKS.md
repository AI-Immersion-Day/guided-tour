## Tips for Success

1. **Start with Discovery**: Begin with task #1-5 to familiarize yourself with the codebase
2. **Use MCP Tools**: Leverage browser automation for testing and analysis tasks
3. **Context7 for Libraries**: Use Context7 MCP to look up documentation for unfamiliar libraries
4. **Iterative Approach**: Break complex tasks into smaller steps
5. **Test Your Changes**: Always verify your implementations work correctly
6. **Document as You Go**: Keep notes on your decisions and discoveries
